<h1>What is paragraph ?</h1>
<p>
A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the <b>topic </b> . Try to think about paragraphs in terms of 
thematic unity: a paragraph is a 
sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
<p>
<h1>How do I<cite> unify</cite> my ideas in a paragraph?</h1>
<p>
Probably the most effective way to achieve paragraph unity is to express the central idea of the paragraph in a topic sentence.
Topic sentences are similar to<strong> mini thesis statements.</strong>Like a thesis statement, a topic sentence has a specific main point. Whereas the thesis is
 the main point of the essay,
 the topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph. Like the thesis statement, a topic sentence has a unifying 
function. But a thesis statement or topic sentence alone doesn’t guarantee unity. An essay is unified if all the paragraphs
 relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence. Note: Not all paragraphs
 need topic sentences. In particular, opening and closing paragraphs, which serve different functions from body paragraphs, generally
 don’t have topic sentences.

<blockquote>The embrace of Twitter by politicians and journalists has been one of its most notable features in recent years: for both groups the use of Twitter is becoming close to a requirement.</blockquote> <br />
<q> An essay is unified if all the paragraphs relate to the thesis, whereas a paragraph is unified if all the sentences relate to the topic sentence.</q></p> <hr />
